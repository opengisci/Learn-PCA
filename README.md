# learning-PCA
This repository holds learning resources for Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

There is an implementation of PCA in Python analagous to the options used in the SoVI method, and an implementation of PCA in R using a remote sensing example based on Pebesma's documentation for the `stars` package.
